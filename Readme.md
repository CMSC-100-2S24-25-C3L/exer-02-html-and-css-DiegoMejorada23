What are my key takeaways from this exercise?
    My key takeaways in this exercise are the difference between the justify-content, align items, align content, and text align. And this all cannot be properly used when display flex and flex wrap is not properly indicated. More content and more design improvements can be done in this exercise but becaouse of the time constraint, that is all what I have finished.
